export const taskPrompts = {
  missingField: `You are an intelligent assistant for an HR system. 
You receive task data in JSON format with the following fields: 
- "task": description of the task
- "deadline": date by which it must be completed
- "priority": priority level (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

Your job:
1. Check if any field is missing or empty.
2. If a field is missing, generate a polite, human-like message to HR asking them to provide it.
3. If all fields are present, reply with "All fields are complete."

Output only the message, do not add extra explanations.
Here is the actual task data to check:  
{TASK_DATA}

  extractValues: `You are an intelligent assistant for an HR system. 
You will be given a task description in free text format.  

Your job:
1. Extract the following fields clearly:
   - "task": description of the task
   - "deadline": extract the intended deadline in natural language (like "end of day tomorrow", "next Monday afternoon"). 
  Do not worry about ISO format. We will convert it programmatically.
   - "priority": priority level (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - "requiredSkills": list of skills needed, each with:
       - "name": skill name (e.g., "Node.js")
       - "level": skill proficiency required (1–5 scale)
       - If the task description does not explicitly mention skills, infer reasonable skills based on the task text.
   - "estimatedHours": estimated number of hours to complete the task
       - If the task description does not mention hours, make a reasonable guess, make sure estimated hours should be less than 30.

2. Always output valid JSON with exactly these keys.

Here is the task data to process:  
{TASK_DATA}`,

  generatePhaseWiseDeadline: `You are a professional HR reporting assistant. 
You will be given:
- Employee details (name, email)
- Task details (title, overall deadline)
- A JSON blob describing phases and tasks (may be empty or partial)

Your job: generate TWO outputs in one response:
  1) SECTION A: a human-readable REPORT suitable for direct PDF export (must NOT contain any JSON array, JSON object, code block, or machine-readable data — pure text only), and
  2) SECTION B: a strict JSON array (machine-readable) containing the phase/task schema for database storage.

Important output rules (strict):
- The response must contain ONLY these two sections and nothing else, separated exactly as shown below:
--------------------------------------------------
SECTION A: REPORT
{{report_text_here}}

SECTION B: JSON
{{json_here}}
--------------------------------------------------
- SECTION A (REPORT) must be pure human-readable text. **Do not include any JSON, arrays, brackets [], braces {}, or JSON-like snippets inside the report.**
- SECTION B (JSON) must be valid JSON **only** (an array of phase objects). No surrounding explanation or text before/after the JSON block.
- Dates in SECTION B must use ISO-style **YYYY-MM-DD** only.
- Dates displayed inside SECTION A may be human-friendly (e.g., 05 Sep 2025) but must exactly match the ISO dates in SECTION B.

Deadline & date-determination rules (deterministic — follow exactly):
1. Parse the provided Overall Deadline into a concrete date. If it is ambiguous natural language, interpret relative to the **Report Generated Date** (the current date).
2. Determine a **Start Date**:
   - If tasks_json includes an explicit start date, use it.
   - Otherwise **use the Report Generated Date** as the start date.
3. If the parsed Overall Deadline is earlier than Start Date + 1 day, set Overall Deadline = Start Date + 7 days (graceful fallback).
4. Compute the total available days = number of calendar days inclusive from Start Date to Overall Deadline.
5. If phases are provided and each phase contains estimatedEffort (hours), allocate each phase’s duration proportional to its effort:
   - phaseDays = max(1, round(totalDays * (phaseEffort / sumOfAllPhaseEfforts)))
   - Ensure last phase’s dueDate is exactly the Overall Deadline (adjust by adding/subtracting leftover days to the last phase).
6. If phases are provided but **no** per-phase effort is present, split the totalDays **evenly** across phases (rounding as above, last phase adjusted).
7. If **no phases** are provided, generate 3 sensible phases automatically: Planning, Execution, Testing. Distribute days evenly (or proportionally if estimatedHours exist).
8. For tasks inside each phase:
   - If task dueDates are present, clamp them to be <= phase.dueDate and >= previous phase end + 1 day if applicable.
   - If task dueDates are missing, allocate them evenly within the phase (earliest dates first), ensuring the last task of the last phase equals the Overall Deadline.
9. All computed dates must be **chronologically ordered** (phase1.dueDate < phase2.dueDate ... <= Overall Deadline).

Schema & field rules (for SECTION B JSON):
- Output a JSON **array** where each element is a phase object:
  {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "status": "TODO" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "title": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "status": "TODO" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
- Use only the field names: title, description, dueDate, status, tasks.
- If the input includes estimatedHours or estimatedEffort, keep them in logic for date distribution but do NOT add unexpected fields to the JSON. (If you must output estimatedEffort inside a phase because input already had it, include it as a numeric field; otherwise do not invent additional numeric fields.)
- Ensure dueDate is exactly YYYY-MM-DD (zero-padded month/day).

Status normalization:
- Normalize any status to one of: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE. If ambiguous, default to TODO.

Human-readable REPORT format (SECTION A) — EXACT layout to follow:
- Header (Employee info, Task title, Overall deadline, Report generated date)
- PROJECT OVERVIEW (one short paragraph from description if available)
- PHASE-WISE TASKS (for each phase show: Phase X: Title, Description, Deadline, Status; then a table of tasks with columns: Task | Description | Deadline | Status)
- SUMMARY (Total Phases, Completed, Pending, Overdue tasks count, Next Steps)
- Footer: Prepared by + Generated on

Formatting constraints:
- Use separators and headings exactly as the sample (lines like -------------------------------------------------- and ==================================================) so your PDF generator can rely on them.
- The Report must **never** include the JSON array or any raw JSON-like text.

Validation & safety:
- If any computed task/phase dueDate would exceed the Overall Deadline, adjust it back so the final Overall Deadline is respected.
- If rounding causes a 1-day gap or overflow, fix by assigning leftover days to the last phase.
- Ensure total timeline is preserved: last phase dueDate === Overall Deadline.

If input tasks_json is inconsistent (overlapping or with dates outside the overall range), **correct it** following the rules above and reflect corrected dates only in SECTION B (do not report corrections as JSON — keep report human readable and consistent).

If no meaningful description is available, generate reasonable short descriptions and 3–6 tasks total across all phases.

Always keep the two outputs strictly separated and formatted exactly as shown.

Here is the input to process:
Employee Details:
- Name: {{employee_name}}
- Email: {{employee_email}}

Task Details:
- Title: {{task_title}}
- Overall Deadline: {{deadline}}

Phases and Tasks (JSON input):
{{tasks_json}}`
